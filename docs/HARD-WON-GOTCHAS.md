# Hard-won gotchas

Rescued 2026-09-07 from `coolify-apps/CLAUDE.md` before that repo was archived.

Every entry below was **found by breaking something in production**, not read in a
changelog. They are kept because they are about **Docker, Postgres and GitHub
Actions** — not about Coolify, which this setup no longer uses. The
Coolify-specific half of the original document (its API quirks, `ports_exposes`
defaults, `fqdn`/`custom_labels` staleness, root-vs-non-root SSH to the Coolify
host) was deliberately left behind.

## Postgres

**Postgres 15+ revokes `CREATE` on the `public` schema from `PUBLIC`.**
`CREATE DATABASE` + `CREATE USER` + `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE` is *not*
enough. The app connects fine and then dies on its first migration with
`permission denied for schema public`, which surfaces as a crash-looping
container rather than an obvious permission error. Also run, inside the new
database:

```sql
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO <user>;
```

**Postgres 18+ changed the expected volume mount point.** Older images expect
`/var/lib/postgresql/data`; 18+ wants a single mount at `/var/lib/postgresql` and
manages the version-specific subdirectory itself (to support `pg_upgrade --link`).
Mounting the old path crash-loops the container on start — **even against a
completely empty volume**. The log explains it if you read it. Found by deploying,
not from release notes. See `metamcp/docker-compose.yml` for the correct form.

**Postgres major versions are not in-place upgradeable by swapping the image
tag.** The migration path is: `pg_dumpall` from the old instance → verify it
restores cleanly into a *throwaway* container of the target version **first** →
point the compose file at a **new, differently-named volume** (keeping the old one
as an automatic rollback point) → redeploy → restore into the fresh instance.

## Container capabilities

**`cap_drop: ALL` breaks any image whose entrypoint drops privileges from root.**
The s6-overlay / PUID-PGID pattern (LinuxServer-style images, the Postgres
official image, and others) starts as root, `chown`s its data, then drops to the
service user. Bare `cap_drop: ALL` breaks that dance and the container
crash-loops. The working set is:

```yaml
cap_drop: [ALL]
cap_add:  [CHOWN, FOWNER, DAC_OVERRIDE, SETUID, SETGID]
```

**Generic "run Chromium in Docker" advice is frequently wrong for the specific
image you are using.** The usual `cap_add: SYS_ADMIN` / `seccomp=unconfined`
recipe assumes Chrome's own sandbox is the problem. For `coollabsio/openclaw-browser`
it is not: live-tested with **zero** extra capabilities — including a real CDP
`Page.navigate` to a real URL — it worked cleanly, no sandbox errors. What it
actually needed was the same privilege-drop set as Postgres above, for the same
underlying reason. **Test the actual image before importing advice about its
class.**

**Passing local tests do not guarantee the config survives a real first boot.** A
second image in the same deployment passed local testing under `cap_drop: ALL`
and then crash-looped in production, because the local runs never combined the
full hardening block with a genuinely fresh container (no persisted `/data`), and
its entrypoint does one-time `chown -R` / `rm -rf` setup as root on first boot.
**Reproduce the exact hardening block against a genuinely empty volume** before
trusting it.

## Docker operations

**`docker compose ps` without `-a` only lists *running* containers.** A
crash-loop check built on plain `ps` cannot see anything that already died — it
reports success even when every container in the stack has exited. Always use
`ps -a`. This bug shipped live in the smoke-test workflow for a while; the fixed
version is in `.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml`.

**A single-sample health check false-positives on a crash-looping container.** A
container that is actively restarting can be sampled mid-cycle and read as
`running` for exactly one poll. Require several *consecutive* successful reads
(3, ~30s) before declaring success, resetting the streak on any non-running read.
Reproduced live: 14 consecutive `exited:unhealthy` reads, then one lucky
`running:healthy` sample that an unfixed check would have accepted.

**Imperative container configuration does not survive a recreate.** `exec`-ing
into a running container to change state — an `ACL SETUSER` grant, a hand-created
Postgres role, a vector collection created by a one-off API call — only changes
the running process's in-memory state. Unless it is also written somewhere the
next container recreation reads from (a mounted config file, an aclfile, a
migration that runs on start), it is gone on the next `up`.

**An image's entrypoint can gate startup on a fixed list of recognised env vars,
even when a real working config was supplied through a more general mechanism.**
Seen live: an image supported a generic `*_CONFIG_JSON` deep-merge var, but its
entrypoint's "is anything configured?" check only knew a fixed list of named vars
and refused to start (`exit 1`) despite a perfectly valid JSON-defined config. Fix
was an inert placeholder purely to satisfy the gate. **Read the actual entrypoint**
(`docker run --rm --entrypoint cat <image> <path>`) rather than assuming the
documented generic mechanism is sufficient to boot.

**A reverse proxy may not route a container until it reports `healthy`.** Traefik
does not route containers that declare a healthcheck while they sit in `starting`
— requests 503 with `no available server` (which means "no router matched", so
look at routing, not the app) even though the container is `running` and its app
answers on its port. Keep healthcheck intervals and `start_period` short, or the
service is invisible for that whole window. Generic to healthcheck-aware proxies,
not specific to any one platform.

## GitHub Actions

**A reusable workflow's `permissions:` block can only *narrow* the caller's
token, never widen it.** A reusable workflow declaring `contents: write,
pull-requests: write` has no effect if the calling repo's own workflow — or the
repo's default — already restricts it. Repos default to read-only Actions tokens,
which makes an upstream-release or Renovate job silently do nothing: exit 0, zero
changes, no error. Set the permission in the **calling** workflow.

**Moving a published git tag** (e.g. a floating `@v1`) is flagged by branch/tag
protection and by consumers pinning to it. Prefer immutable tags for anything
another repo depends on.
